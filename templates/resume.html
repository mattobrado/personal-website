            <h5>October 2021 - Present</h5>
            <p><em>John Deere</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Decreased error in trajectory estimation for combine harvesters by 80% by independently finding the root cause of the issue and developing a solution, unblocking stalled progress on autonomous driving</li>
              <li>Improved automated steering performance for combine harvesters by creating a dynamic model of the machine and using it to optimize the steering algorithm in Matlab</li>
              <li>Designed a 4-wheel-steer version of the algorithm, cutting the turn-radius of fertilizer sprayers in half and saving farmers money by reducing damage to crops</li>
